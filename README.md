Men are the clearly the largest demographic using the game (484, as compared to 81 females, and 11 other/non-disclosed).
However, women average purchasing 1.39 items, as opposed to men who average 1.35, and those in the other/non-disclosed category average 1.36.
The other/non-disclosed category spends a greater amount on average per person, but with only 11 people in this gender, the number is low and not very useful. It is more important to note that women spend more, on average, than men ($4.47 compared to $4.07).
